                <h3>Obedience Training</h3>
                <p>Why Puppy Training Is Important
                    A great dog trick can entertain even the toughest canine critic. But, puppy training is about more than dazzling a crowd. Training school teaches your dog important behavioral skills and good manners. Additionally, it exposes them to a variety of other dogs and people so that they're comfortable in diverse social situations.1
                    Your puppy's first three months are crucial to their development. Young dogs are highly impressionable and adept at retaining new information. Exposing your puppy to all sorts of sights, sounds, people, and other dogs will help prepare them for a life as an adult.2</p>

                <h3>Alpha Dog Or Positive Training</h3>
                <p>Purely positive reinforcement has been made popular by trainers such as Victoria Stilwell, of Animal Planet's TV show It's Me Or The Dog. It's also the method taught by Dawn Sylvia-Stasiewicz. Based in Hume, Va., she trained Bo, the Obamas' dog.
                    Sylvia-Stasiewicz says more dominant training and techniques focus too much on “bad” things a dog does and force the animal to figure out, through trial and error, what they must do in order not to be punished.</p>

                <h3>Hunting Dog Training</h3>
                <p>Hunting with your dog is an exhilarating way to experience outdoor life with your furred friend. Dogs have been hunting with humans for millennia. Many hunting breeds were actually developed specifically to find, flush out, or retrieve game. But that doesn't mean that your dog will automatically know what to do on a hunt.

                    Before you head out in search of game with your canine companion, you'll need to train your dog. Aside from helping you find and retrieve the quarry you're after, dogs also must become used to loud sounds like gunshots. You'll also need to bring along the proper hunting gear necessary to keep your dog safe and satisfied in the field.</p>
